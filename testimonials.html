            <p>"Elena was brilliant with Sandy. She is knowledgeable and has a lot of experience with cats being a cat mum herself. She genuinely cared for Sandy and kept me updated with messages and pictures of my beloved boy regularly and was happy to answer any questions to reassure me, the anxious cat mum. I can highly recommend Elena."</p>
